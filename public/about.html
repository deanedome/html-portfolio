<p>As an Entrepreneur at heart, my first business was started when I was only 14 years old. As gaming was one of my
  earliest hobbies, I quickly understood the importance of customer relationship management as well as providing 
  quality products. I began developing and coding plugins for a Minecraft server I set up with a friend of mine. Mainly
  working with languages such as Ruby, Lua, and utilizing Notepad++ to create plugins to ensure an entertaining experience
  for avid gamers looking for a new server to participate in and enjoy with friends.

<p>Fast forward a decade, I started a new business in eSports called Tactical Banditry. To date, we have secured multiple
  partnerships with corporations to successfully run over 100 online tournaments totaling with a prizing of over $30,000.
  We have been grateful to contract and develop a talent team of over 40 freelancers who went on to pursue their passion's
  into full time careers. We take pride in developing individual feedback from our players to ensure professionally run
  tournaments for tomorrow's superstars. Our highest achievement to date was increasing Velocity Next's participation in
  their events by over 480%. While this has been a great experience developing this business, I have decided to move on
  and focus on my career in software engineering and development.
